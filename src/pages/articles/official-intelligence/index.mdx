Technology keeps forging its footprints deeper into human existence at a breakneck pace, amplifying every aspect of our lives. Throughout history humanity has etched an intricate tapestry of progressive innovation; an undeniable testament to our ingenuity. But, there is an ever present knot within our ranks—a fear of the change and advancement that we ourselves have orchestrated.

## The Fear of AI

One of the biggest changes lately is the abrupt growth of artificial intelligence in our daily lives. Why are there so many fears that arise along with AI? We see it reflected in art through movies like Terminator, Ex Machina, The Creator (which turned out to be a surprisingly good watch btw). In 2001 Space Odyssey, HAL gained consciousness in the same way that we did, we as apes that is. The apes got wise & made a weapon, turned human & started wars… so many wars! Humanity has always strived for superiority, fearing and battling anything smarter or stronger than we are, leading us down a path of incessant conflict, both against nature and against each other. The recent explosion of AI resounds the ancient tone of this struggle, presenting a perceived threat to our supremacy.

## Is AI a Threat or a Tool?

Fellow humans, I want to assure you that AI is not here to dwarf our capabilities. It's here to augment them. To view AI as a threat is like a carpenter being intimidated by their own saw; sure, it's what & could be dangerous. But, it is a human that makes it that way. Once the superiority of our species was achieved, humans have always been the greatest threat to humanity. But, on the other side of that same coin. Humans have always had the greatest potential to care for other humans & extend each other's abilities and happiness.

## Official Intelligence

At this point, the Large Language Models that power Artificial Intelligence have ingested a very large swath of the collective human intelligence. That makes them really good at cliches. It could write a Hallmark movie. But, it couldn't have written Everything, Everywhere, All at Once. It can tell you all about the concept of mathematics. But, it can't create new mathematical discoveries. That's the same for science. It can most definitely help in any field to converse about what has already been done. But it takes what I call 'Official Intelligence'—our uniquely human ability for creativity and original thought—to come up with anything truly original. The intricacies and complexities of the human mind remain largely unknown. Even with huge strides in neuroscience and psychology, we can only claim to understand a meager percentage of the brain's functionality—leaving vast neural mechanisms of our consciousness shrouded in mystery. Equipped with such a fathomless entity and new tools like AI to better leverage it, we sit on the precipice of boundless possibilities. The question is—are we prepared to leverage AI to elevate our mental capabilities to new horizons? Or, will the cycle continue of a small sect using the new tool, just like the bone in Space Odyssey, to oppress the rest of us?

## The Power of Language

The supremacy of humanity lies not in our ability to craft weapons. In spite of that, it really resides in our exceptional capacity to communicate and coordinate with each other. Beyond serving as our primary mode of expression, language has been the catalyst to our civilization's advance, fostering the sharing of knowledge across generations and paving the way for effective collaboration. Driven by linguistic capabilities, we have produced sophisticated tools, agricultural practices, and technologies, empowering us to transform our environments, coexist with other species, and achieve incredible feats of collective organization.

## A Historical Parallel

When Johannes Gutenberg introduced the world to the printing press in the 15th century, a seminal shift in communications ensued, ushering in an era of mass dissemination of information and the democratization of knowledge. Just like Gutenberg's groundbreaking invention, AI has the potential to shape conversations and streamline meaningful engagement among humans.

## Embracing Transformative Dialogues

Can introducing AI into our mental realm create transformative dialogues? What if we accept AI as an ally, an amplifier of our inherent capacities bounded solely by the sphere of our imagination. I'm hopeful that we can find our voice in harmony with AI & human consciousness, to overcome the ongoing narrative of fear, and inspire a symphony of human minds in conversation, our official intelligence enhanced by the artificial. And, let's not forget that artificial intelligence is merely a collection of previous human intelligence. The human mind is such an awe inspiring mechanism and you have one right in your skull. I hope you use it because we all can benefit from the unique thoughts and ideas that you have to offer.
