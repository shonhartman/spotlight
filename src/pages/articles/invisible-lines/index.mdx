A middle manager, frustrated over a missed deadline, unfairly barks at a young intern. The intern, carrying the weight of the undue remarks, goes home & loses patience with his little sister. Their father, picking up on the tension, subconsciously vents his irritation online, leaving a hurtful comment under a friend's post. A stranger reading the harsh comment, is influenced, and takes it out on a waiter at dinner. These fractures, starting from a singular moment of frustration, ripple out into shards of negativity.

Science proves this shrapnel has cascading effects across society, a study by Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler illuminated the profound impact of our social connections in ways that tend to support the intriguing theories of Carl Jung's collective unconscious. This study, exploring the behavior of 5,000 individuals through a web of more than 50,000 social connections—encompassing family, friends, and coworkers—reveals a fascinating narrative about the ripple effects of our actions within these networks.

Imagine I make a small change in my lifestyle—Let’s say, I start smoking cigarettes again (I’m coughing just thinking about it). According to the findings of Christakis and Fowler, this decision has an echo. Like a stone cast into a pond, the ripples extend far and wide, with close family and friends being 50% more likely to follow suit. But, even a friend of one of these people who I have never met is 20% more likely to light up. Get this, even a friend of that friend who doesn’t even know that my close friend or that I even exist, is 10% more likely to pick up the habit!
This phenomenon underscores a principle that social scientists have long mused over: behaviors, whether shaped by peer pressure or familial influence, have a tendency to proliferate within our closest circles & far beyond, leapfrogging over direct connections. suggesting a labyrinth of invisible threads that bind us in a complex web of influence, reaching beyond the confines of our conscious awareness. This study was published before social media digitally put all of this at our fingertips and into a database.

This intricate dance of influence and behavior is the embodiment of Carl Jung's collective unconscious—a realm where shared human experiences and archetypes dwell, transcending individual consciousness. Are these invisible connections manifestations of a universal mind? The science shows a form of social contagion, operating beneath the surface, that suggests our behaviors and influences are part of a deeper, possibly innate, network of human connection that echoes Jung's vision of a collective psyche. A divine thread weaving through the fabric of humanity. 

Jung also presents the idea of the shadow—the darker aspects of our collective psyche shaped by societal norms, values, and indoctrination. It reflects not only the shared ideals but also the societal horrors, isolationism, and binary thinking that fosters a sense of separation from one another and the collective whole.

This exploration into the nature of social contagion and the collective unconscious compels us to reevaluate the significance of interconnectedness (or the lack thereof) in shaping our behaviors, health, and collective consciousness. It beckons us to ponder that biblical notion of separation as the deepest form of suffering, highlighting the challenge and opportunity for humanity to recognize and transcend these invisible barriers. Through the lens of Christakis and Fowler's study, we can delve deeper into understanding the invisible ties that bind us, urging a collective awakening to the intricate web of influences that shape our lives and the world around us.

To me, these findings are not mere observations but a call to action—how powerful are these unseen forces that influence our lives? Can I embrace the interconnectedness that defines the human experience? What does that look like? I think these questions are worth asking. The journey through the shadows and into the light of understanding these invisible ties may very well be the path to unlocking the full potential of our collective humanity.

I wonder, if negativity can spread like this, can the same be said for positivity? Do even our smiles, thank you's and small acts of kindness towards one another hold the potential to proliferate outward in unseen networks of positivity?

Let’s do this one more time…
A middle manager, congratulating herself for handling a stressful situation without losing her temper, decides to compliment a young intern on a task well-executed. Energized by the recognition, the intern returns home and patiently helps his little sister with her school project. Their father, picking up on the positive energy at home, reciprocates with a caring emoji on his friend’s misguided social media post. A friend of that friend, feels a warm feeling seemingly out of nowhere, and decides to leave an unexpectedly generous tip for the waiter at dinner. These sparks, starting from a singular show of respect and recognition, proliferate out into radiating waves of positivity and healing. Maybe we can heal the world one smile at a time.
