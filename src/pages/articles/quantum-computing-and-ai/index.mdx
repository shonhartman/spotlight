During a recent conversation with two of my favorite thinkers that I'm lucky enough to be able to converse with in person, we explored the impact of quantum computing on artificial intelligence.

One fascinating application that has constantly been on my mind ever since I started using ChatGPT is the potential use of the transformer neural network architecture to create an intelligence model based on the work of a renowned author or thinker. This involves analyzing the author's body of work to capture their intelligence, thought processes, and decision-making patterns.

Imagine being able to consult with the intelligence of Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi, or even your own great grandmother. With an intelligence model, we could create a chatbot that simulates the person's responses to questions or situations, allowing readers to engage with their ideas and wisdom in a whole new way.

One of the main challenges in creating intelligence models is dealing with the vast amount of data that needs to be analyzed. Traditional computers struggle with this task, but quantum computers are ideally suited for it. Their ability to handle multiple calculations simultaneously means they can process and analyze complex data sets much more quickly and efficiently than traditional computers. This could significantly speed up the process of creating an intelligence model and allow us to capture even more nuance and complexity in an author's work.

The potential benefits of being able to consult with the intelligence of great thinkers and creators are incredibly intriguing, and quantum computing could play a key role in making this a reality. By creating an intelligence model that captures the author's unique thought processes and decision-making patterns, we could gain new insights and perspectives on their work. This could revolutionize the way we engage with literature, philosophy, and other areas of study.
