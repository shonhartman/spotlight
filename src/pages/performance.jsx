I was surprised that we both got cast & even more surprised to get a leading role! I discovered why I was given that role when I thrived up there on that stage night after night honing the performance & embodying the character. It turns out that all of the hard work I had put into my musical performance over the years translated to an incredible amount of unnoticed acting skill. I was called upon for other roles & asked to audition for other productions which I was cast in. But, then COVID happened & the momentum crashed to a halt. My son lost interest. But, it still lingers in me & I hope satisfy it with many roles to come."
